This is the solution for "The Labyrinth" puzzle.

DISCLAIMER: The latest commit gets 100% when the code is submitted, and the previous commit solves all the practice puzzles.
So this makes it a "random" solution in the sense that, for the cases 4 and 6 (or 7) the ability for it to solve it depends on where
it starts to go first (left or right). 
While I realize that this is not the ideal solution, it is a solution nevertheless. So I will consider this solved and move on (since it is solved 100% anyway)
